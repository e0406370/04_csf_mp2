Railway serves as the actual hosting platform where a web application is deployed and runs. 
It provides the server infrastructure and tools necessary to host the application.

Cloudflare acts as a proxy and sits in front of the Railway-hosted application. 
It intercepts and manages incoming web traffic, provides various services such as 
DNS management, SSL/TLS encryption, content caching, DDoS protection, and firewall security.

In essence, Cloudflare acts as a protective barrier and optimization layer for the Railway-hosted application.
It ensures that the web application performs well, remains secure, and is protected from various online threats.
